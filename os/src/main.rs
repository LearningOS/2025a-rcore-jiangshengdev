//! The main module and entrypoint
//!
//! Various facilities of the kernels are implemented as submodules. The most
//! important ones are:
//!
//! - [`trap`]: Handles all cases of switching from userspace to the kernel
//! - [`task`]: Task management
//! - [`syscall`]: System call handling and implementation
//! - [`mm`]: Address map using SV39
//! - [`sync`]: Wrap a static data structure inside it so that we are able to access it without any `unsafe`.
//! - [`fs`]: Separate user from file system with some structures
//!
//! The operating system also starts in this module. Kernel code starts
//! executing from `entry.asm`, after which [`rust_main()`] is called to
//! initialize various pieces of functionality. (See its source code for
//! details.)
//!
//! We then call [`task::run_tasks()`] and for the first time go to
//! userspace.
